= Spring Cloud Gateway Server

== Gatway Server

Spring Cloud Gateway is built on Spring Boot 2.x, Spring WebFlux, and Project Reactor. As a consequence, many of the familiar synchronous libraries (Spring Data and Spring Security, for example) and patterns you know may not apply when you use Spring Cloud Gateway. If you are unfamiliar with these projects, we suggest you begin by reading their documentation to familiarize yourself with some of the new concepts before working with Spring Cloud Gateway.

== Role of Gateway Server
* `Routing:` Control incomming request and outgoing response.
* `Security:` Single point security like authentication and authorization.
* `Monitoring:` Monitoring requests-responses, their health and situations.
* `Canarying:` It is basically routing request based on the criteria of request like headers and parameters.
* `Monolith Strangling:` Put monolith behind the gateway and then slowly divide the monoliths into microservices.
* `Resilience:` As it can manupulate responses if any errors are inside the microservice arena, it can hide it by manupuliting the response.

== Configuring Gatway Server
We are using java based configuration as example.

. Start a spring boot project with
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Eureka Client
. Configure the gateway server as an Eureka Client like the previous ones.
. Make a Java class with `@Configuration` annotation for gateway configurations. Name it anything you want.
. Create a `@Bean` method that returns `RouteLocator`, Parameter is builder with type `RouteLocatorbuilder`. This RouteLocator will map your services URIs.
. Create routes by `builder.route().route(r -> )`
. Inside `route()` we need to add 3 parameters.
- `r.path():` Antmatcher of the URL
- `.uri():` Actual Service URL or In case of EUREKA instance, lb://name-of-service - Here lb means load balance.
- `id():` A identifier of the route.
. Add `.build()` at the end to end making routes and the gateway.

== Java based configuration example
.GatewayConfiguration.java
[source, java]
public class GatewayConfiguration {
   @Bean
   public RouteLocator getRoutes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder){
       return builder.routes().route(
               r-> r.path("/movie/**").uri("lb://movie-service").id("movieService")
       ).build();
   }
}
+
[NOTE]
You can also configure gateway using properties file.
Spring Cloud Gateway is different from Netflix Zuul Gateway, it uses no-blocking architecture which uses less resources. Because it queues messages.

== YML based route configuration example
.application.properties
[source, yml]
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: path_route
          uri: lb://movie-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/foo
          filters:
            - AddResponseHeader=X-Response-Red, Blue
            - RewritePath=/foo, /movie


== How to use gateway to dynamically route requests to services
* Add discovery client depedencies
* Add the discovery locator configurations in props file.

[source, properties]
server.port=8080
spring.application.name=gateway-server
spring.cloud.gateway.enabled=true

[source, properties]
spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled=true
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId=true
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lower-case-service-id=true
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka, http://localhost2:8762/eureka

The LoadBalancerClientFilter looks for a URI in the exchange attribute property using ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR.

If the URL has a lb scheme (e.g., lb://baeldung-service) it'll use the Spring Cloud LoadBalancerClient to resolve the name (i.e., baeldung-service) to an actual host and port.

== Components of Gatway Server

image::gateway flow[]

* Predicate
* Filters
** Pre-Filter
** Global-Filter
** Post-Filter

== How It Works?
* Client makes a request. It goes through Handler Mapping process. The purpose of this process is to
detect the right type of request and handle them. This is done by matching predicates
from the comming requests. These predicates can be applied into the URL, Header, Cookies, Body of Request
etc.

* After getting a match the server can manupulate the request as it wants. This manupulation
can be done by applying filters into the Request.
* Global filters are common filters that are applied to all requests.
* Pre-filters are applied before the request goes to the downstream service.
* Post-filter are applied to manupulate the response that comes from the downstream server.

.The Process in Essence.
```
Client >
> Mapping Handler >
> Web Handler [ Pre Filter, Proxy Filter ] >
> Proxied Service >
> Web Handler [ Post Filter] >
> Mapping Handler >
> Client
```

== Blocking and Non Blocking (How is it different from netflix Zuul?)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7931537/whats-the-difference-between-asynchronous-non-blocking-event-base-architectu[What's the difference between: Asynchronous, Non-Blocking, Event-Base architectures?]
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47092048/how-is-spring-cloud-gateway-different-from-zuul[How is Spring Cloud Gateway different from Zuul?]

- Other solutions uses Blocking Architecture
- Spring Cloud Gateway is Non-Blocking

*Explanation:*
Consider a serial port, from which code will want to receive 1,000 bytes.

In a blocking-read architecture, the code will wait until either 1,000 bytes have arrived or it decides to give up.

In an asynchronous-read architecture, the code will tell the driver it wants 1,000 bytes, and will be notified when 1,000 bytes have arrived.

In a non-blocking architecture, the code may ask at any time how many bytes have arrived, and can read any or all such data when it sees fit, but the only way it can know when all the data has arrived is to ask; if the code wants to find out within a quarter second when the 1000th byte has arrived, it must check every quarter-second or so.

In an event-based architecture, the serial port driver will notify the application any time any data arrives. The driver won't know how many bytes the application wants, so the application must be able to deal with notifications for amounts that are smaller or larger than what the application wants.

image::non-blocking[]

In this image, we can see that the request comes to the event queue,
it stays there, there is a even loop goes on and on, it provides the actual call
when the resource is available. In this way all requests are geting answerd and
resource consuption is significantly less.




== Different parts of the route
- id
- a destination URI
- a collection of predicates
- a collection of filters


== Predicates
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/2.1.x/multi/multi_gateway-request-predicates-factories.html[Full List]

=== Important Ones

* Before, After, Between
* Header Route
* Cookie Route
* Host Route
* Method GET, POST Route
* Path Route
* Query Route
* RemoteAddr(IP) Route

== Filters

https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-gateway/2.2.2.RELEASE/reference/html/#gatewayfilter-factories[Full List]

Filters allow the modification of the incoming HTTP request or outgoing HTTP response in some manner.

=== Important Ones

* AddRequestHeader
* AddRequestParameter
* AddResponseHeader
* Circuit Breaker
* RedirectTo
* RewritePath
* RequestRateLimiter

=== Detailed Explaination of Filters

* `AddRequestHeader:` AddRequestHeader=X-Request-red, blue
This listing adds X-Request-red:`blue header to the downstream request’s headers for all matching requests. It can also add path variable of predicate to request header.  AddRequestHeader=X-Request-Red, Blue-{segment}

* `AddRequestParameter:` - AddRequestParameter=red, blue. This will add red=blue to the downstream request’s query string for all matching requests.  It can also add a path variable of predicate to request header.

* `AddResponseHeader:` AddResponseHeader=X-Response-Red, Blue, This adds X-Response-Foo:`Bar header to the downstream response’s headers for all matching requests. AddResponseHeader is aware of URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime. - AddResponseHeader=foo, bar-{segment}

* `DedupeResponseHeader:` -DedupeResponseHeader=Access-Control-Allow-Credentials Access-Control-Allow-Origin This removes duplicate values of Access-Control-Allow-Credentials and Access-Control-Allow-Origin response headers in cases when both the gateway CORS logic and the downstream logic add them.

* `Hystrix GatewayFilter:` - Hystrix=myCommandName This wraps the remaining filters in a HystrixCommand with a command name of myCommandName.
args:`
name:` fallbackcmd
fallbackUri:` forward:`/incaseoffailureusethis
- RewritePath=/consumingserviceendpoint, /backingserviceendpoint

* `Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker GatewayFilter

* `FallbackHeaders:` The FallbackHeaders factory lets you add Hystrix or Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker execution exception details in the headers of a request forwarded to a fallbackUri in an external application

* `MapRequestHeader:` When the client receives a specific parameter in the request, it maps it to another type of parameter and routs it to the server.

* `PrefixPath:` If you want to send something to the server by adding something before the URI to the path in which the request will come, then use it as if you put / mypath in the filter / hello will actually go to the server / mypath / hello

* `RequestRateLimiter:` Sets the limit of the request, if crossed, returns "too many request".
An optional argument is KeyResolver which has to be defined in bin form. By default, the resolver tries to take a name from the principal. If you don't get the name then don't let the request go. This is the default behavior. If you want, you can set the property and make a system to let the request go even if you don't get a resolver.

* `Redis RateLimiter:` It can be used to set some parameters to easily limit the request, request token, replenishment rate, burst capacity, etc. It is recommended to set the rate limit for making your own bin.

* `RedirectTo:` If you want to redirect a request with a redirect code, use it, if you give a valid URL with 302 in the status, it will redirect nicely there.

* `RemoveResponseHeader:` If you add parameters to this filter, it will be removed when the response is received.
If you want to apply to all routes, spring.cloud.gateway.default-filters and have it applied to all routes. I can use.

* `RemoveRequestParameter:` If you get this query parameter, you will get it out.

* `RewritePath:` A path through regular expression can actually convert it to another path. It can also take parameters again.
RewritePath = / red (? <segment> /?.*)`, $ \ segment
For a request path of / red / blue, this sets the path to / blue before making the downstream request. Note that the $ should be replaced with \ \ because of the YAML specification.


* `RewriteResponseHeader:` Use regular expressions to change the header value and change it again. RewriteResponseHeader = X-Response-Red,, password = [^ &] +, password = **`*` `For a header value of / 42? User = ford & password = omg! What & flag = true, it is set to / 42? User = ford & password = **`*` `& flag = true after making the downstream request. You must use \ to mean $ because of the YAML specification.

* `SaveSession:` If you integrate Spring Security with Spring Session and want to ensure security details have been forwarded to the remote process, this is critical. If I want to save the session and go forward. Sometimes Lazy doesn't save sessions due to being given to Faizi.

* `SecureHeaders:` To secure the request by adding many headers. Reading this blog post will clear up a lot:` https:`//blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html

* `SetPath:` That path changes from one cell to another. The parameters are also Sapor

* `SetRequestHeader:` This GatewayFilter replaces (rather than adding) all headers with the given name It is also useful for header manipulation.

* `SetResponseHeader:` Sem works for response.

* `SetStatus:` is used to change HTTP status.

* `StripPrefix:` Cuts the prefix in front of the URL. If the value is 2, the front 2 prefixes will be cut off.

* `Retry:` It takes several parameters, how much gla will retrieve, what status code will return, what exceptions may come Habijabi must be careful while using it.

* `RequestSize:` If the size of the request is too large, the request will not be allowed to go.

* `ModifyRequestBody:` It is used if you want to modify the body of the request.

* `Response Body:` You can change the response.

* `Default Filters:` To add a filter and apply it to all routes, you can use spring.cloud.gateway.default-filters. This property takes a list of filters. The following listing defines a set of default filters:`

=== Global Filters
* Global Filters: The GlobalFilter interface has the same signature as GatewayFilter. These are special filters that are conditionally applied to all routes.

== Refreshing the Route Cache

Refreshing the Route Cache
To clear the routes cache,

* make a POST request to `/actuator/gateway/refresh.` The request returns a 200 without a response body.
